1-1-Implement a search algorithm for the vacuum cleaner world problem, but in this case, predicting three rooms to be vacuumed. Use a strategy that avoids cycles during the search process.

2.Implement a search algorithm for the jug problem. The problem involves two jugs with capacities of 3 and 4 liters, respectively. Knowing that we can fill, empty or transfer water from one jug to the other, find a sequence of steps that leaves the 4-liter jug ​​with exactly 2 liters of water. Use a strategy that avoids cycles during the search process.
Representation of the tuple states [X, Y]

3. Implement a search algorithm for the problem of a farmer who is on the left bank of a river, carrying a fox, a chicken, and corn. The farmer needs to get to the other bank of the river with all his cargo intact, but he only has a boat with the capacity to carry only him and one load. The farmer can cross the river as many times as necessary, but in his absence the fox may eat the chicken or the chicken may eat the corn.

4. Create a state space representation for the 8-piece puzzle problem. The problem consists of moving puzzle pieces horizontally or vertically so that the final configuration is reached. The movements performed must cause the piece in question to occupy the empty position adjacent to it. The movements must be performed sequentially so that the final configuration is reached. After creating the state space representation, create a search algorithm to solve the problem.

5. Implement a greedy search algorithm for the problem of traveling across the map of Romania. The objective of the problem is to go from Arad to Bucharest in the shortest possible path. In addition, the algorithm must visit the least possible number of candidate states. 

6. Implement an A* search algorithm for the problem of traveling across the map of Romania. The objective of the problem is to go from Arad to Bucharest in the shortest possible path. In addition, the algorithm must visit the least possible number of candidate states. 

7. Implement the A* search for the path finding problem using Euclidean distance. The map must be represented by an M x N matrix and the starting point and the destination point must be established. In addition, there may be obstacles on the path that must be avoided. For the heuristic, consider the lateral movement actions with a cost of 10 and the diagonal movement actions with a cost of 14.
